## **Google Chart API Extension**

Code to display an array of data with the Google Chart API. 
There is an option to turn on or off data series by clicking on their legend 
entry and also an option to turn on or off ALL data series by clicking on 
a specific "hide/show all" legend entry. 

This is a modification of the code from Andrew Gallant which you can check out here:

Here you can checkout how it looks like with sample data:
